Project Brief: A/B Testing for Dar Al-Amoudi Store's Honey Products

As a marketing data analyst, I conducted an A/B testing project for Dar Al-Amoudi Store's natural Yemeni honey products. 
The store wanted to improve its marketing strategy and increase sales during the new "Sumar" honey season.

The project involved comparing the performance of two different images and two ad texts to determine the most effective marketing strategy for increasing sales. 
We set goals and standards, defined the target audience and KPI, and created ads to achieve our objective. Our metric was CPC and messaging conversations started.

The first A/B test compared two images, one with explanatory text and one without. 
The results showed that the ad with the image without caption text was more effective in generating messaging conversations and had a lower cost per result compared to the ad with the image and caption text.

We then conducted a second A/B test to compare the first and second ad texts. While there was not enough data to determine a clear winner between Ad Group B and Ad Group C, the data suggested that Ad Group B may be the best performing ad group.

Overall, the A/B testing project provided valuable insights into the most effective marketing strategies to increase sales of natural honey products. By using these insights to improve their advertising strategy, Dar Al-Amoudi Store can better reach their target audience and improve sales.

to showcasing the power of A/B testing in improving marketing strategies. The project includes detailed information on the project objectives, target audience, ad creation, A/B testing methodology, and project results. The project brief also highlights the importance of conducting A/B testing to improve advertising strategies and increase sales.

By sharing this project on Github, I hope to inspire other marketing professionals to use A/B testing to optimize their advertising strategies and improve sales for their businesses. The code and data used in the project are also available for others to use and build upon.

Thank you for taking the time to review this project brief, and I look forward to hearing your feedback.
